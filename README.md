# tadlstats - A statistics dashboard app for [Traverse Area District Library](https://www.tadl.org/)

This application, designed to run in [dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku), reads data from a series of CSV files and presents a lovely dashboard using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), [bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/), and [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/).

It can be easily customized to other multi-location systems or single-location systems by creating a single configuration file, and setting your CONFIG environment variable to that filename.
